# CornerAnnotator

A simple tool to mark corners of square objects in images.

I needed to obtain coordinates of bingo tickets on 400 images, and simply made this tool.

This is in no way production ready code, and hacks is visible on the code. But hey it works!

A points.json file will be generated with the coordinates of the corners.
